# Parkinson-s_disease_detection

Parkinson's disease is a ndisease that affects the central nervous system and there are no specific tests to detect it. There is no guaranteed cure,
but detecting the disease early can make existing treatments more effective.<br>
This project includes the exploratory data analysis and model buiding for detecting Parkinson's disease using Python 3 in Jupyter Notebooks.<br>
The dataset is taken from Kaggle and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/nidaguler/parkinsons-data-set) <br>
Various classification algorithms like Logistic regression, Random Forest Classifier, KNN classifier, etc have been implemented and the best results are
given by the KNN classifier which achieved an average accuracy of 94.8% and maximum accuracy of 97.4%
